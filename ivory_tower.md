You can mute <T>, hit the button, that’s your right
But don’t you trash the ones who coded through the night
Fourteen years old, wrote a string quartet
Built a score editor 'fore I learned to drive

Not bragging…
Just be careful who you scan, better read the room
I remember you 1st SC symposium, that’s Birmingham
Where I caught a pretentious kid, bright but so green
Talking sonification like you knew what that would mean
I thought it was academic, just a scam to get a check
Now I think different—growth is what I expect
But people think whatever, and that’s the point I’m stressing
You might be clever, don’t mean others need your lesson

I remember how you did him, made him feel like dirt
'Cause he ain’t read Adam Smith—watch your words, they hurt
I read Marx front to back, read Smith the same
Still cringed when I saw you put that man to shame
Leave the ivory tower, Köln ain’t the whole world
Talk more to real people, let your ego get unfurled
Take this off of GitHub, have the conversation first
'Fore you write up guidelines with ambiguous words

I’m not saying anyone here has bad intentions. I’m saying: vague guidelines + subjective interpretation + no clear process = a framework that can be weaponized later, by anyone, for any reason. That’s how these things have historically worked.

That’s a history lesson. You were not born to see that in your motherland.

Today it’s a “polite suggestion,” tomorrow it’s a precedent for enforcement. I’ve already seen here how quickly “everyone knows that” turns into an “official position.” People here are really confused about all this shit.
If human life doesn’t mean anything for anyone here, so I will not think much of you either.

I don’t want another MF ruining someone’s peace
Writing codes of conduct like they scholars, like they priests
*If tragedy KOCK-KNOCK happen, that’s on u-know-who
Rules they don’t understand with pointers near the throat

If human life don’t mean nothing to the ones who preach
Then I won’t think much of you—that’s the ground I reach
But deep down… deep down I know that ain’t your soul
You just naive with life, you ain’t played that role
You just naive with life
You just ain’t been through it
You just naive with life
One day you gon’ prove it

I’m out. Sto
