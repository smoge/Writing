UNMASKED

    fragments     shatter     pretense
    what rises         cannot sink
                                back down
        eye-gleam betrays
        the kept-back truth
        your silence      .

    stop the         circular         unconcealing 
    life isn't           this shell chess of
                                   perpetual escape
    throw open         the windows
    let morning          split the sky
                                   raw

    birth-violence          necessary rupture
    body          electric with
                         primal screams

    wild             child-heart
    bursting         with
                         untamed joy
