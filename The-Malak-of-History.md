Listen,  
you who've let slip the blueness of the sky.

In spaces where echoes unclasp their hands,  
a dark narrative unfurls, voices entangled in raqs intricate,  
chaos, not a singular entity but fragmented,  
a hunger, a blend of countless existences.  
The Malak of History, Angelus Novus,  
spins tales of loss within a despairing kaleidoscope,  
their spirits, out of sync, whisper in the void,  
shattered mirrors reflect our collective dimming.

Reaching, fingers spelling division, not unity,  
finding calm within summoned storms,  
reimagining, amidst the quiet of stifled life,  
a fractured yet whole collective evening.

Alam â€” not just a single sorrow but a scattered show,  
casting our shared devastation in diverse paths,  
as the storm nears, seeking shelter, side by side yet alone,  
comprehension broken, swallowed by fear's obscurity.

Resistance, fragmented, weaves through their narrative,  
flooding the storyteller and their hollow tales.  
Memories, once ties, now reveal  
the desires of a complex 'we,' a construct,  
through time, scattered, not together,  
a melody arises, not mere echoes but the world spirit's scream:

"Where are you, you sons of bitches?  
Will you continue to pretend, to ignore?"

Watching the relentless attack on our collective essence,  
marked by catastrophes, they murmur of shared resilience,  
confronting the darkness, not united but as shards of light,  
a mosaic where paths and voices blend,  
unveiling the Malak's powerless fear.
